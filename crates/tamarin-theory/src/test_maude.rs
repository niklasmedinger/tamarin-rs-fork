//! The ONE maude-resolution probe every maude-gated test module in this crate
//! shares — the workspace-idiom equivalent of the integration suites'
//! `tests/common/mod.rs` helpers.  Before it existed each `_tests.rs` carried
//! its own near-identical copy, and the copies drifted (one accepted a
//! set-but-dangling `MAUDE_PATH` that the others assert on).
//!
//! `crates/tamarin-theory/tests/oracle_solver.rs` keeps a mirrored copy: an
//! integration test cannot see a `#[cfg(test)]` module of the library it
//! links.  Keep the two in sync.
//!
//! The same structural barrier keeps a small number of copies alive in the
//! other crates.  A sibling crate cannot reach this `pub(crate)` module
//! either.  So the discipline scan in this file's `tests` module checks the
//! complete workspace, not this crate alone.  Its `ALLOWED` array lists the
//! sanctioned copies.  The array also records the obligation that each copy
//! carries.
