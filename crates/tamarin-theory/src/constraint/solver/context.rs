//! Solver context — port of the `ProofContext` data type from
//! `Theory.Constraint.System`.
//!
//! The Haskell `ProofContext` is a fat record carrying every piece of
//! per-theory information the solver needs:
//!
//! - The underlying signature (with Maude handle).
//! - The protocol rules and their AC variants.
//! - Sources / case-distinctions used to bias goal solving.
//! - Heuristic / tactic configuration.
//! - Whether to use induction, whether diff mode is on, etc.
//!
//! The Rust port carries all of these, split across two structs: the
//! per-lemma / post-construction-mutable fields owned directly by
//! [`ProofContext`], and the immutable-after-build bundle
//! ([`ProofContextShared`]) held behind an `Arc` so a Maude-swap clone is
//! a refcount bump rather than a deep copy.
