//! Proof-search driver — port of the `Theory.Proof` step loop.
//!
//! In Haskell, a proof tree (`LTreeProof`) grows by repeatedly:
//! 1. Picking a `ProofMethod` via the heuristic ranking.
//! 2. Executing it to produce zero or more child sub-systems.
//! 3. Recursing on each child.
//!
//! `candidate_methods` builds the FULL heuristic-ranked candidate list
//! (Simplify + every open goal as `SolveGoal`, plus `Induction` in the
//! initial state per `pcUseInduction`) and picks the first method whose
//! `exec_proof_method` succeeds — mirroring `rankProofMethods` /
//! `execMethods`.  The driver dispatches on `ProofContext::cut`: the
//! default runs iterative-deepening DFS with memoized re-expansion
//! (only `Sorry: depth limit` leaves are re-run across iterations),
//! optional per-child parallel expansion, oracle handling, and
//! solved-path extraction — a port of HS's `cutOnSolvedDFS`; the
//! `--stop-on-trace=seqdfs` strategy instead runs a single serial
//! unbounded-depth pass — HS's `cutOnSolvedSingleThreadDFS` (see
//! `run_proof_search`).
//!
//! Under the default `Dfs` strategy, termination is bounded by the
//! ID-DFS depth alone (`MAX_DEPTH`,
//! doubling from 4) — `cutOnSolvedDFS` (Theory/Proof.hs:854-884) has only
//! `dMax` and no step/node budget, doubling `dMax` from 4 with no
//! upper bound.  HS terminates because it deepens over a finite proof
//! tree (any TERMINATING lemma's tree is finite, so once `dMax`
//! exceeds its depth `findSolved` returns `NoSolution` and HS stops);
//! the effective bound is the actual proof depth, tens-to-low-hundreds
//! of single-path steps for any real lemma.  We mirror the unbounded
//! doubling, retaining only a far-out cap (`cap = usize::MAX / 4`)
//! as a Rust-only loop-termination guard so a genuinely
//! non-terminating proof strategy aborts rather than overflows.  No
//! realistic Tamarin proof approaches this cap, so it never flips a
//! verdict.  The per-lemma wall-clock deadline is a Rust-only
//! addition, OFF by default (opt in via `TAM_PROVE_DEADLINE_MS`); see
//! `proof_deadline`.
