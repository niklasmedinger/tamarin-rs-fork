//! Port of `Theory.Constraint.Solver.Reduction`.
//!
//! In Haskell, `Reduction` is a state-fresh-disjunction monad over a
//! `ProofContext` reader:
//!
//! ```haskell
//! type Reduction = StateT System (FreshT (DisjT (Reader ProofContext)))
//! ```
//!
//! Each constraint-reduction rule runs as a `Reduction`, possibly
//! producing multiple cases. The monad provides primitives like
//! `insertNode`, `insertEdge`, `insertGoal`, `solveTermEqs`, etc.
//!
//! For the Rust port we model `Reduction` as a struct holding mutable
//! `System` state plus a `ProofContext` reference, with its own
//! fresh-variable supply (see `Reduction::maude`). Disjunctive results
//! are surfaced as `Vec`s rather than a monad-level `DisjT` layer. This
//! module implements the full reduction surface: `substSystem`,
//! `conjoinSystem`, the `solve*Eqs` family, `insertFormula`, and the
//! associated CR-rules.
